This repository demonstrates a subtle Unicode-related bug in Go.  The `bug.go` file contains a seemingly innocuous `fmt.Println` statement, but it might not print the expected output due to an incorrect handling of Unicode characters. The solution provided in `bugSolution.go` corrects this issue.  The problem arises when dealing with Unicode characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), often encountered in languages like Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.
